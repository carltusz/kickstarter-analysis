# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

Kickstarter campaigns were analyzed to understand the how financial goals and campaign timing influence the success of different categories of campaigns, and in different regions.

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project, data from Kickstarter campaigns from 2015 until present were analyzed to determine how financial goals, seasonal timing, region and category impacted the outcome of a campaign.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to make recommendations to the client on which factors are most influential in the success of a Kickstarter campaign; particularly for Theater productions in the United States of America.

## Analysis and Challenges
Screenshots included in this repository show how the data was analyzed with respect to campaign launch date, categories and financial goals. The launch date appeared to impact the ratio of successful campaigns to failed campaigns under the theater category. The financial goals also implied that campaigns are most successful when their foals are under a certain threshold. A campaign is most likely to be successful when launched within this timeframe, with a target goal which is below the threshold.

This analysis required minor cleaning of the data to obtain readable dates, and to seperate the parent category and subcategory of the campaigns. Additional challenges were met when aggregating the data. Additional Pivot Tables and other tables were created to support the analysis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Successful Theater campaigns tend to be most successful when launched in May, June and July, respectively. They are least successful when launched in December. The failed campaigns do not have a clear function with launch month. The ratio of successful to failed campaigns is highest in May, followed by June and July, it would be advisable to begin the campaign in May if possible.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Plays were found to be most successful when the fundraising goal was below $5000. Goals below $5000 had a 73% success rate, while campaigns with a goal $5000 to $10000 are successful only 55% of the time. The client indicated a desired budget of around $10000. A goal of that magnitude may impact the success of the campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No major difficulties were encountered when completing this assignment. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Launch date influenced the ratio of successful to failed campaigns for the theater category, but not for technology.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Campaigns which asked for too high of a goal tended to be less successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This data is comprised only of the outcomes and basic figures. We cannot analyse the timeline or distribution of the contributions. This data would be interesting to see if there was any bias to the contributions, and if outlier contributions made some campaigns successful that otherwise wouldn't be.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Comparing campaign duration against the success rate for a given category would provide insights on the appropriate length of campaign.
